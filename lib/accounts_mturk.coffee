###
  Add a hook to Meteor's login system:
  To account for for MTurk use, except for admin users
  for users who are not currently assigned to a HIT.
###
Accounts.validateLoginAttempt (info) ->
  return true if info.user?.admin # Always allow admin to login

  # If resuming, is the worker currently assigned to a HIT?
  if info.methodArguments[0].resume?
    unless info.user?.workerId and Assignments.findOne(
      workerId: info.user.workerId
      status: "assigned"
    )
      throw new Meteor.Error(403, "Your HIT session has expired.")

  # TODO Does the worker have this open in another window? If so, reject the login.
  # This is a bit fail-prone due to leaking sessions across HCR, so take it out.
#  if info.user? and UserStatus.connections.findOne(userId: info.user._id)
#    throw new Meteor.Error(403, "You already have this open in another window. Complete it there.")

  return true

###
  After a successful login, save the worker's IP address and
  trigger initial assignment
###
Accounts.onLogin (info) ->
  # User object should always exist here, since account was already created
  return if info.user.admin

  # However, user data (workerId) may not be up to date, so use our own
  # method to grab the assignment for this user
  # This is especially pertinent in testing
  # TODO verify this is valid as we reject multiple connections on login

    Meteor._debug "Nonexistent assignment for user " + info.user._id
    return

  asst.setData { ipAddr: info.connection.clientAddress }

  return

###
  Authenticate a worker taking an assignment.
  Returns an assignment object corresponding to the assignment.
